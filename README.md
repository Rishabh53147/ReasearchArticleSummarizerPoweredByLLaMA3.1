# Reasearch Article Summarizer powered by LLaMA 3.1

Following project is our team's final year project for bachelor degree in computer science. The project consists of two sections -- the user interface and the LLM model. as of Making this repository the project is still under development and the deadline for completion of the base prototype is december 2024. This project a research article summarizer that uses the arXiv API to access the latest reasearch in mathematics, science and computer science. the user interface allows anyone to filter out these paper in whichever way they desire. The main purpose of this project is to use the LLaMA 3.1 model to summarize the articles into more precise and easy to understand point such that users need not waste time in reading hundreds of article and only read the the ones where they might find interest as per their own topic.
